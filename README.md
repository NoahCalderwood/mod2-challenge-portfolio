# Portfolio
This is a portfolio containing all of my creations so far in my career. There are many more to come and I will be updating this more.
As a new programmer, I wanted a place to show off the projects that I learned heavily from as well as had the most fun with, including this one.
I learned so much about HTML and CSS while making this porfolio. This helped me understand many different ways to structure CSS and use its different resources.

Here are some screenshots of the portfolio:
